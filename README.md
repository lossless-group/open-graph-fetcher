# Getting Started as a Developer from Open Source

**Warning:** This is built assuming pnpm is your package manager. If you are using yarn or npm, you will need to modify the package.json file and may need to modify the code.

Fork the repository, clone it to your local machine, and install dependencies:

```
pnpm install
pnpm add -D esbuild @types/node builtin-modules
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

## Packages, Dependencies, Libraries:

```json
	"devDependencies": {
		"@types/node": "^24.0.12",
		"@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "8.36.0",

		"builtin-modules": "5.0.0",

## Using Symbolic Links to Test Your Plugin

If you're like us, you have a directory housing all your code projects. To use your plugin as you develop it, just create a symbolic link. Here is my example, but you will need to use your own path structure:

```bash
ln -s /Users/mpstaton/code/lossless-monorepo/obsidian-plugin-starter /Users/mpstaton/content-md/lossless/.obsidian/plugins/
```

Once you symbolic link from your code to your Obsidian plugins directory, you can develop the plugin but you need to:
1. Make sure it's built and running.
2. Toggle the plugin on in Obsidian Settings: Community Plugins.
