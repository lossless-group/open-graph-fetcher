# Test Progress Bar Animation

This file is used to test the smooth progress bar animation in the OpenGraph Fetcher plugin.

## What to Expect

When you run the "Fetch OpenGraph Data for Current File" command, you should see:

### 1. Initial State
- Progress bar starts at 0%
- Status shows "Extracting URL from current file..."

### 2. Incremental Progress (0% → 90%)
- **Increment**: +10% every 2 seconds
- **Duration**: Each increment animates in 300ms
- **Status**: "Fetching OpenGraph data..."
- **What happens**: Progress bar increases steadily to show ongoing activity, stopping at 90%

### 3. Completion Animation (90% → 100%)
- **Duration**: 600ms (0.6 seconds)
- **Easing**: Ease-out cubic (smooth deceleration)
- **Status**: "Successfully fetched and updated OpenGraph data for [URL]"
- **What happens**: Progress bar smoothly completes to 100% after the operation finishes

## Animation Features

### Smooth Easing
The animation uses an ease-out cubic function:
- Starts fast and slows down naturally
- Provides a polished, professional feel
- Matches modern UI design patterns

### Responsive Design
- Animation automatically cancels if the modal is closed
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for optimal performance
- Respects the user's system preferences

### Visual Enhancements
- Progress bar has a gradient fill
- Smooth transitions between states
- Consistent with Obsidian's design language

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Successful Fetch
1. Run the command
2. Watch the incremental progress: 0% → 10% → 20% → 30% → 40% → 50% → 60% → 70% → 80% → 90%
3. Wait for API response (progress stays at 90%)
4. Watch the smooth 90% → 100% completion animation
5. See unified success message: "Successfully fetched and updated OpenGraph data for [URL]"
6. See "Done" button appear

### Error Handling
1. Run the command with an invalid URL
2. Progress bar will still animate smoothly
3. Error message will appear in status
4. Progress bar remains at last animated position

### Cancellation
1. Start the fetch process
2. Close the modal during animation
3. Animation should stop immediately
4. No memory leaks or ongoing processes

## Technical Details

### Animation Implementation
```typescript
private animateProgressTo(targetValue: number, duration: number = 500): Promise<void> {
  // Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animation
  // Ease-out cubic easing function
  // Automatically handles cleanup
}
```

### CSS Enhancements
```css
.opengraph-progress {
  transition: all 0.1s ease;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.opengraph-progress::-webkit-progress-value {
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--interactive-accent), var(--interactive-accent-hover));
  transition: width 0.1s ease;
}
```

## Performance Notes

- Animation runs at 60fps using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Minimal CPU usage during animation
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Responsive to system performance settings

## Accessibility

- Animation respects user's motion preferences
- Progress bar is keyboard accessible
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode supported
